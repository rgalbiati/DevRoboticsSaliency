        - VideoInputMap.py : finished bottom up saliency model with trackbars 
                implemented.  NOTE: program opens saliency map in window on top 
                of video input.  Once that window is moved, the trackbars no 
                longer work
        - videos : folder of test videos.  All videos also have human gaze 
                data recorded 

Purpose: Program reads from either computer's internal webcam or video input 
        and creates saliency map for each frame based on pixel brightness, 
        pixel saturation, and movement. The program then uses surf featurs to 
        identify features on the map.  

Dependencies : Python 3, Open CV

Usage : Running the program with no additional command line arguments will 
          launch using the computer's internal webcam.  Alternativly, a 
          user can run the program with the path to a video as a command line 
          argument
